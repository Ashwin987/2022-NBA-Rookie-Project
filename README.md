INTRODUCTION

The NBA draft is annually regarded as one of the most anticipated sporting events. Essentially, the draft involves college, international, and a recent addition of g-league players being drafted by each of the 30 NBA teams.In preparation for the draft, all these teams send professional scouts to analyze these players and see how they can provide a proper fit for their teams. The scouting process can typically take weeks even months to figure out who can help address their team's needs at the moment and fix these concerns. However, with the introduction of the groundbreaking fields of machine learning and data science, scouts have a new tool that allows them to accurately assess their needs and find the best suitable players for their teams. Our article specifically focuses on the 2022-2023 NBA draft class, and utilizes the individual stats through Data Science techniques, for the purpose of analyzing the impact these players can make in the upcoming season.
